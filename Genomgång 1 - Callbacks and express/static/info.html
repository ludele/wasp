            Linux is generally defined as an operating system using the Linux kernel,
            a kernel in an operating system works as the core program of the operating
            system that communicates between the hardware components and the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linux itself is a kernel, so to make a whole operating system you would need
            a multitude of other programs and utilities to make it usable and interactable.
            In the case of Linux when it is defined as an operating system it refers to a
            operating system that uses the Linux kernel, these variations are usually
            called Linux distributions or distros.
          </p>
          <p>
            A linux distribution is a whole operating system that is built upon the linux kernel,
            these distributions are usually very similar to each other, and they are mostly built
            using the GNU Project which is a huge project of smaller components and programs that
            work together to create an operating system (this is the reason why linux is sometimes
            called GNU/Linux).
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common difference between different distributions is that they use different package
            managers which is a program that handles the systems software packages. One of the first Linux
            distributions that are still important today is the distribution called Debian. From Debian
            there has branched of alot of other distributions, for example, the popular distribution Ubuntu.
            The distributions that are branched from debian use the same package manager, debian package manager
            is grounded in stability in which packages are maintained for a long time and updates are slow, this
            makes debian-based distributions very stable as long as the maintained packages are stable.Â
